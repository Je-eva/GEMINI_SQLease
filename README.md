## Motivation behind the Project
The idea came to my mind when i was working on SQL queries.Idea struck me on implementing a site where we give our table and type in english language for the particular data from table or to get the query to edit the table.
This project was chosen with the users in mind who lack knowledge about SQL databases but need to retrieve data from tables or make basic edits to suit their preferences.
Our app provides the necessary queries for both retrieving and editing data, making database tasks accessible to all.


Additionally, this project empathizes with data analysts, allowing them to focus on their core tasks by handling routine database operations efficiently for end-users or company clients.
By automating these tasks, it streamlines workflows and enhances productivity.
The future scope of this application is unlimitless.
